<h1>Final Project</h1>
<p id="p1">The purpose of the program was to make a replica of the classic game snake. We created the game with a snake which is represented by a rectangle and the objective of the game was to collect apples which are represented by ellipses. The apple is randomly generated after it is collected and the snake has to survive as long as possible. The way the game ends is if it collides within itself or if it crashes in the walls that we have designed. We used different functions to to randomize the position of the apple, the growth of the snake, the movement of the snake as well as how the snake checks if it makes contact with itself or the walls.
